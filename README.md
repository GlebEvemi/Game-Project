# Slime Arena
Slime Arena - our project name.

Members - Artjom Aristov, Gleb Pushin.

Roles in the group - Gleb Pushin and Artjom Aristov main developers and designers.

We will design in Adobe Photoshop.

We will develop in Visual Studio Code with using pygame library: sys library, random library, pyautogui library, pygame.locals, math library

We are using 2 files, 1 is the game(Slime Arena), and second is the GameSetting that we too need to import to our game file.

Main idea of the game : We have 1 player, who is getting attack by slimes. Player should kill them. We got a score of killed slimes. If the player kills the slime then he will get a gem and it counts to his score. The player got 100 health. Player has opportunity to get level up.

These libraries need to download: 

W-A-S-D is the standart move, by pressing U you will upgrade, and by pressing space you will attack.

When player got 10 score he can exchange it for a level up, that will give him speed boost, damage boost and slimes's damage will increase.
