# Slime Arena
Slime Arena - our project name.

Members - Artjom Aristov, Gleb Pushin.

Roles in the group - Gleb Pushin and Artjom Aristov main developers and designers.

We will design in Adobe Photoshop.

We will develop in Visual Studio Code with using pygame library (need to install), sys library, random library, pyautogui library (need to install), pygame.locals, math library.

We are using 2 files, 1 is the game, and second is the GameSetting that we too need to import to our game file.

Main idea of the game : We have 1 player, who is getting attack by slimes. Player should kill them. We got a score of killed slimes. If the player kills the slime then he will get a gem and it counts to his score. The player got 100 health.

WASD is the standart move, by pressing U you will upgrade, and by pressing space you will attack.

When player got 10 score he can exchange it for a level up, that will give him speed boost, damage boost and slimes's damage will increase.
